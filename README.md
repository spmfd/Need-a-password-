## Description

This project was designed to put my javascript knowledge to the test. The best part of working with javascript and coding's top down reading approach, you can really take on this project is small bite sized portions as you continue. Focusing on one task at a time not only made it easier, but if I ever got stuck on one portion of a project I could work on another one as I think about how to resolve that previous issue. I did hit a couple of walls, but luckily with the help of one of the tutors, Sean, I was able to be pointed in the right direction. For example, I was able to get the user selection bouillion to populate in an array however I wasn't able to figure out how to choose a random option from the array. She was able to enlighten me on the "concat" method. After doing some research on it I was able to simply add it to my existing structure and it worked perfectly. 

The biggest thing I learned while working on this project is learning the logic of Javascript and how to read the information. After the pre-work guide I didn't know if I would be able to get Javascript down however after some practice and some help I feel like I'm in a great spot. I'm able to read the code and understand the function logics, if there is a method I'm not familiar with I would just use one of my many resources to research it and continue to learn.
